    <p><strong>"The Yellow Wallpaper"</strong> is a short story by American writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlotte_Perkins_Gilman">Charlotte Perkins Gilman</a>, 
        first published in January 1892 in <em>The New England Magazine</em>. It is regarded as an important early work of American
        feminist literature for its illustration of the attitudes towards mental and physical health of women in the 
        19th century. It is also lauded as an excellent work of horror fiction.</p>

    <p>The story is written as a collection of journal entries narrated in the first person. The journal was 
        written by a woman whose physician husband has rented an old mansion for the summer. Forgoing other rooms 
        in the house, the husband confines the woman to an upstairs nursery. As a form of treatment, the husband 
        forbids the journal writer from working or writing, and encourages her to eat well and get plenty of air 
        so that she can recuperate from what he calls a "temporary nervous depression – a slight hysterical 
        tendency", a common diagnosis in women at the time. As the reader continues through the journal entries, 
        they experience the writer's gradual descent into madness with nothing better to do than observe the 
        peeling yellow wallpaper in her room.</p>

    <h2 id="plot_summary">Plot Summary</h2>
    <p>The story describes a young woman and her husband. He imposes a rest cure on her when she suffers "temporary 
        nervous depression" after the birth of their baby. They spend the summer at a colonial mansion, where 
        the narrator is largely confined to an upstairs nursery. The story makes striking use of an unreliable narrator 
        in order to gradually reveal the degree to which her husband has "imprisoned" her due to her physical and
        mental condition. She describes torn wallpaper, barred windows, metal rings in the walls, a floor "scratched 
        and gouged and splintered," a bed bolted to the floor, and a gate at the top of the stairs, but blames all 
        these on children who must have resided there.</p>
    <p>The narrator devotes many journal entries to describing the wallpaper in the room – its "sickly" color, its 
        "yellow" smell, its bizarre and disturbing pattern like "an interminable string of toadstools, budding and 
        sprouting in endless convolutions," its missing patches, and the way it leaves yellow smears on the skin and 
        clothing of anyone who touches it. She describes how the longer one stays in the bedroom, the more the 
        wallpaper appears to mutate, especially in the moonlight. With no stimulus other than the wallpaper, the 
        pattern and designs become increasingly intriguing to the narrator. She soon begins to see a figure in the 
        design. Eventually, she comes to believe that a woman is creeping on all fours behind the pattern. Believing 
        she must free the woman in the wallpaper, she begins to strip the remaining paper off the wall.</p>
    <p>When her husband arrives home, the narrator refuses to unlock her door. When he returns with the key, he 
        finds her creeping around the room, rubbing against the wallpaper, and exclaiming, "I've got out at last... 
        in spite of you." He faints, but she continues to circle the room, creeping over his inert body each time 
        she passes it, believing herself to have become the woman trapped behind the yellow wallpaper.</p>

    <h2 id="interpretations">Interpretations</h2>
    <h3>Charlotte Perkins Gilman</h3> 
    <p>Gilman used her writing to explore the role of women in America around 1900. She expanded upon many issues, 
        such as the lack of a life outside the home and the oppressive forces of a patriarchal society. Through 
        her work, Gilman paved the way for writers such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alice_Walker">Alice Walker</a> 
        and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sylvia_Plath">Sylvia Plath</a>.</p>
    <p>In "The Yellow Wallpaper," she portrays the narrator's insanity as a way to protest the professional and 
        societal oppression against women. While under the impression that husbands and male doctors were acting with 
        their best interests in mind, women were depicted as mentally fragile. Women’s rights advocates of the era 
        believed that the "outbreak" of this mental instability was the manifestation of their setbacks regarding the 
        roles they were allowed to play in a male-dominated society. Women were even discouraged from writing because it 
        would ultimately create an identity and become a form of defiance. Gilman realized that writing <br>
        became one of the only forms of existence for women at a time when they had very few rights.</p>
    <p>After the birth of her first daughter, Gilman suffered postnatal depression and was treated by Dr. Silas Weir 
        Mitchell, the leading expert on women's mental health at the time. He suggested a strict 'rest cure' regimen 
        involving much of bed rest and a blanket ban on working, including reading, writing, and painting. After three 
        months and almost desperate, Gilman decided to contravene her diagnosis, along with the treatment methods, 
        and started to work again. Aware of how close she had come to a complete mental breakdown, the author wrote ”The 
        Yellow Wallpaper” with additions and exaggerations to illustrate her criticism of the medical field. 
        Gilman sent a copy to Mitchell but never received a response. (Gilman was ultimately proven right in her disdain 
        for the "rest cure" when she sought a second opinion from Mary Putnam Jacobi, one of the first female 
        doctors and a strong opponent of this theory, who prescribed a regimen of physical and mental activity that 
        proved a much more successful treatment.)</p>
    <p>She added that "The Yellow Wallpaper" was "not intended to drive people crazy, but to save people from being 
        driven crazy, and it worked". Gilman claimed that many years later, she learned that Mitchell had changed 
        his treatment methods. However, literary historian Julie Bates Dock has discredited this. Mitchell continued 
        his methods, and as late as 1908 – 16 years after "The Yellow Wallpaper" was published – was interested in 
        creating entire hospitals devoted to the "rest cure" so that his treatments would be more widely accessible. 
        Gilman gives her greatest thanks to Richard Bauer for being the only man who believed in her.</p>
    <h3>Feminist Interpretations</h3>
    <p>This story has been interpreted by feminist critics as a condemnation of the male control of the 19th-century 
        medical profession. Throughout the short story, the narrator offers many suggestions to help her get better, 
        such as exercising, working, or socializing with the outside world. Her ideas are dismissed immediately while 
        using language that stereotypes her as irrational and, therefore, unqualified to offer ideas about her condition. 
        This interpretation draws on the concept of the "domestic sphere" that women were held in during this period.</p>
    <p>Many feminist critics focus on the degree of triumph at the end of the story. Although some claim the narrator 
        slipped into insanity, others see the ending as a woman's assertion of agency in a marriage in which she felt 
        trapped. The emphasis on reading and writing as gendered practices also illustrated the importance of the 
        wallpaper. If the narrator were allowed neither to write in her journal nor to read, she would begin to "read" the 
        wallpaper until she found the escape she was looking for. Through seeing the women in the wallpaper, the narrator 
        realizes that she could not live her life locked up behind bars. At the end of the story, as her husband lies 
        on the floor unconscious, she crawls over him, symbolically rising over him. This is interpreted as a victory over 
        her husband at the expense of her sanity.</p>
    <p>Susan S. Lanser, a professor at Brandeis University, praises contemporary feminism and its role in changing the study 
        and the interpretation of literature. "The Yellow Wallpaper" was one of many stories that lost authority 
        in the literary world because of an ideology that determined the works' content to be disturbing or offensive. 
        Critics such as the editor of the <em>Atlantic Monthly</em> rejected the short story because "[he] could not forgive 
        [himself] if [he] made others as miserable as [he] made [himself]". Lanser argues that the same argument of devastation 
        and misery can be said about the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edgar_Allan_Poe">Edgar Allan Poe</a>. 
        "The Yellow Wallpaper" provided 
        feminists the tools to interpret literature in different ways. Lanser argues that the short story was a 
        "particularly congenial medium for such a re-vision ... because the narrator herself engages in a form of feminist 
        interpretation when she tries to read the paper on her wall". The narrator in the story is trying to find a 
        single meaning in the wallpaper. At first, she focuses on the contradictory style of the wallpaper: it is 
        "flamboyant" while also "dull", "pronounced," yet "lame," and "uncertain" (p. 13). She takes into account the 
        patterns and tries to organize them geometrically, but she is further confused. The wallpaper changes colors 
        when it reflects light and emits a distinct odor that the protagonist cannot recognize (p. 25). At night the 
        narrator can see a woman behind bars within the complex design of the wallpaper. Lanser argues that the unnamed 
        woman was able to find "a space of text on which she can locate whatever self-projection". Just like the 
        narrator as a reader, when one comes into contact with a confusing and complicated text, one tries to find a 
        single meaning. "How we were taught to read," as Lanser puts it, is why a reader cannot fully comprehend the text. 
        The patriarchal ideology had kept many scholars from being able to interpret and appreciate stories 
        such as "The Yellow Wallpaper". With the growth of feminist criticism, "The Yellow Wallpaper" has become a 
        standard text in many curricula. Feminists have made a significant contribution to the study of literature, 
        according to Lanser, but she also remarks that if "we acknowledge the participation of women writers and readers 
        in dominant patterns of thought and social practice then perhaps our own patterns must also be 
        deconstructed if we are to recover meanings still hidden or overlooked."</p>
    <p>Martha J. Cutter points out that many of Charlotte Perkins Gilman's works address a "struggle in which a 
        male-dominated medical establishment attempts to silence women". Gilman's works challenge the social 
        construction of women by a patriarchal medical discourse that forced them to be "silent, powerless, and passive".
         In the period in which Gilman wrote, women were frequently considered (and treated) as inferiors, 
         prone to be sickly and weak. In this time period, it was thought that women who received formal education 
         (amongst other causes) could develop hysteria, a now-discredited catchall term referring to most 
         mental health diseases identified in women and erroneously believed to stem from a malfunctioning uterus 
         (from the Greek <em>hystera</em>, "womb"). At the time, the medical understanding was that women who spent 
         time in serious intellectual pursuits (such as university education) over-stimulated their brains, which 
         in turn led to states of hysteria. Many of the diseases diagnosed in women were considered to be a matter of 
         a lack of self-control or self-rule. Medical practitioners argued that a physician must "assume a tone of 
         authority" and that a "cured" woman is defined by being "subdued, docile, silent, and above all subject to 
         the will and voice of the physician". A hysterical woman craves power. To be treated for her hysteria, she 
         must submit to her physician, whose role is to undermine her desires. Often women were prescribed bed 
         rest as a form of treatment, which was meant to "tame" them and keep them imprisoned. Treatments such as this 
         were a way of ridding women of rebelliousness and forcing them to conform to expected social roles. 
         In her works, Gilman highlights that the harm caused by these types of treatments for women, i.e., "the rest 
         cure", has to do with how her voice is silenced. Paula Treichler explains: "In this story diagnosis' is 
         powerful and public. ... It is a male voice that ... imposes controls on the female narrator and dictates how 
         she is to perceive and talk about the world.' Diagnosis covertly functions to empower the male physician's 
         voice and disempower the female patient's." The narrator in "The Yellow Wallpaper" is not allowed to 
         participate in her treatment or diagnosis and is completely forced to succumb to everything in which her 
         doctor and in this particular story, her husband, says. The male voice is the one which forces control on the 
         female and decides how she is allowed to perceive and speak about the world around her.</p>
    <h3>Other</h3>
    <p>"The Yellow Wallpaper" is sometimes cited as an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gothic_literature">
        Gothic literature</a> for its themes of madness and powerlessness. Alan Ryan introduced the story by 
        writing: "quite apart from its origins [it] is one of the finest, 
        and strongest, tales of horror ever written. It may be a ghost story. Worse yet, it may not." Pioneering horror 
        author <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H._P._Lovecraft">H. P. Lovecraft</a> writes in his essay 
        <em>Supernatural Horror in Literature</em> (1927) that "'The Yellow Wallpaper' 
        rises to a classic level in subtly delineating the madness which crawls over a woman dwelling in the hideously 
        papered room where a madwoman was once confined".</p>
    <p>Helen Lefkowitz Horowitz wrote that "the story was a cri de coeur against Gilman's first husband, artist Charles 
        Walter Stetson and the traditional marriage he had demanded." Gilman attempted to deflect blame to 
        protect Gilman's daughter Katharine and her step-mother, Gilman's friend Grace Channing. Horowitz consults 
        the sources of Charlotte's private life, including her daily journals, drafts of poems and essays, and intimate 
        letters, and compares them to the diary accounts of her first husband. She also mines Charlotte's diaries for 
        notes on her reading. She shows how specific poetry, fiction, and popular science shaped her consciousness 
        and understanding of sex and gender, health and illness, emotion and intellect. Horowitz makes a case that 
        "The Yellow Wall-Paper", in its original form, did not represent a literal protest against Mitchell (a neurologist 
        who treated Gilman in 1887) and his treatment. Rather, it emerged from Charlotte's troubled relationship with 
        her husband Walter, personified in the story's physician. In demanding a traditional wife, Walter denied 
        Charlotte personal freedom, squelched her intellectual energy, and characterized her illness.</p>
    <p>In another interpretation, Sari Edelstein has argued that "The Yellow Wallpaper" is an allegory for Gilman's 
        hatred of the emerging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellow_journalism">yellow journalism</a>. Having created <em>The Forerunner</em> in November 1909, Gilman made it 
        clear she wished the press to be more insightful and not rely upon exaggerated stories and flashy headlines. 
        Gilman was often scandalized in the media and resented the sensationalism of the media. The relationship 
        between the narrator and the wallpaper within the story parallels Gilman's relationship with the press. The 
        protagonist describes the wallpaper as having "sprawling flamboyant patterns committing every artistic sin". 
        Edelstein argues that given Gilman’s distaste for the Yellow Press, this can also be seen as a description of 
        tabloid newspapers of the day.</p>
    <p>Paula A. Treichler focuses on the relationship portrayed in the short story between women and writing. Rather 
        than write about the feminist themes which view the wallpaper as something along the lines of "... the 
        'pattern' which underlies sexual inequality, the external manifestation of neurasthenia, the narrator's 
        unconscious, the narrator's situation within patriarchy", Treichler instead explains that the wallpaper can be a symbol 
        to represent discourse and the fact that the narrator is alienated from the world in which she previously could 
        somewhat express herself. Treichler illustrates that through this discussion of language and writing, in the 
        story, Charlotte Perkins Gilman is defying the "... sentence that the structure of patriarchal language imposes". 
        While Treichler accepts the legitimacy of strictly feminist claims, she writes that a closer look at the text 
        suggests that the wallpaper could be interpreted as women's language and discourse. The woman found in the 
        wallpaper could be the "... representation of women that becomes possible only after women obtain the 
        right to speak". In making this claim, it suggests that the new struggle found within the text is between two 
        forms of writing; one rather old and traditional, and the other new and exciting. This is supported by the fact 
        that John, the narrator's husband, does not like his wife to write anything, which is why her journal containing 
        the story is kept a secret and thus is known only by the narrator and reader. A look at the text shows that 
        as the relationship between the narrator and the wallpaper grows stronger, so too does her language in her 
        journal as she begins to increasingly write of her frustration and desperation.</p>
